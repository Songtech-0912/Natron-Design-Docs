# Natron Design Documentation

Welcome to the Natron Design Docs! These guidelines are intended to form the basis of designing for Natron, the open-source VFX and compositing software. Natron offers a comprehensive suite of tools for any compositor, enabling everything from basic video manipulation to cinematic multi-pass compositing. We believe that design is an integral part of establishing Natron as a fully-featured, professional compositing suite, and we have carefully put together these docs for that reason. As with all parts of Natron, these docs are a living document, and are freely available under an open-source license.

## Why Design?

You might wonder why an open-source project like Natron would require designers. Surely, the features of the application are more important! So why waste valuable time on design?

Because open-source projects, especially ones like Natron, can have _great_ potential. However, without good design, we have no way of showing that potential. There is a world of difference between open-source software with _good_ design - like VS Code or Atom - and software with _bad design_. If Natron can aspire to professional design standards, we can realize that untapped potential. And we can release the amazing, community-building power of free and open-source software.

Conversely, users also have finite time and effort. They don't have all day to spend, looking for a compositing application, nor do they have the effort to extensively test each and every compositing application for its features. Most won't even care about free and open-source. And if they are presented with a terrible-looking user interface, they're not likely to want to use it. Even if they have to use it on a daily basis, using software with terrible GUIs – something Sibelius/Vim is famous for – becomes a pain.

Plus, design isn't just an aesthetical need - it's a practical one, too. Accessibility and responsive design are no longer optional in today's day and age. If your website isn't designed to scale properly on a mobile device, or to accomodate the needs of disadvantaged users, you are excluding a massive number of people from using your site.

### Our Guiding Principles

We want to show that open-source projects and good design are not mutually exclusive. In other words, we want to:

* Create immersive and engaging experiences that breathe life into Natron
* Create a recognizable visual identity that will represent our project
* Laying down a foundation of intuitive tools that will help Natron grow

Translating these abstract guiding principles something tangible is what design aims to do. The *implementation* is the hard part, but it's also what ultimately counts, and that's what we will discuss in these docs.

### Getting Started

This guide is intended for developers, hobbyists, professional designers, and novices alike. It's meant to take you into the mind of a designer, while also keeping design simple and easy to understand. If you're interested in those topics, read on!

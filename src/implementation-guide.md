## Implementation Guide

### Natron's Approach to Design

Here at Natron, we face tremendous challenges in encorporating design. We have a small design team, limited monetary resources, and Natron is non-profit. Furthermore, as an open-source project, we have high standards to live up to. Out of these special circumstances, we developed a unique approach to design.

First, where possible, we rely on open standards to share, work, and publish designs. Regardless of the software we use to make our mockups, we share designs as widely-supported SVG files. Then, we use `git` to synchronize our design assets (SVG or otherwise) to GitHub. That means we can do awesome things - like time travel! Designers can make breaking changes sometimes. But thanks to GitHub's version control, we can go back in time and grab the unchanged version, without a hitch!

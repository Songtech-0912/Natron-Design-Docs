## Ethical Design

Modern designers are often forced between two equally horrible options: do what a client wants at the expense of user ethics, or risk losing their job. Sometimes, clients are not as altruistic as one might wish. Sometimes, convenience and revenue are prioritized over user privacy. And sometimes, the shortage of time compells you to make an inaccessible design. Natron aims to avoid these common pitfalls of the design industry, by following a rigourous set of good-faith rules.

### No Ads Policy

We don't serve ads. While we may, at certain times and situations, offer monetary rewards (such as competition prizes and bug fixer bounties), we will *not* treat a user as a cash cow.

### No Unneccesary Telemetry Policy

Like it or not, telemetry gives a developer unjust power over a user. It allows a developer access to information about users that may or may not be clear.

### No Dark Patterns

Design shouldn't be used to confuse, deceive, or manipulate. We won't implement [dark patterns](https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern), a phrase used to describe designing with the express intent of misleading a user to do something they normally wouldn't. For instance, we won't try to access user permissions, spam you, or prevent you from doing something. Our installation and uninstall processes are simple and transparent.

### Always Opt-Out

Sometimes, a design subconsciously encourages a user to make a certain choice. This is frequently seen in subscriptions, where users checking the box for a subscription also check boxes for other, unncessary services. We will make sure to not do this.

### Clear & Inclusive Language

With the exception of developer documentation, we try to write in a style that does not reference a specific culture, nor uses technical jargon. We are committed to explaining a topic in the most direct, understandable way possible, rather than confusing the user with bloated descriptions.

### Stay Open-Source and Transparent

### 100% Accessibility

Accessibility halfway is good, but *not enough*. Our wish is to allow all users to benefit from open-source software and non-restrictive licensing --- and that means we will do our best in delivering accessible experiences.

### What if you find a violation of these rules?

Tell us immediately. Good communication and fast resolution is the best way to enforce these rules.

### How far have we gotten?

## Overview

I am a proud member of the [Natron](https://github.com/NatronGithub/Natron) community, and like many like-minded community members, Natron's slow downfall and lack of development deeply affected us. That's why we decided to rejuvenate Natron, with a [website redesign effort](#), a [UI refresh](#), and lots of cool stuff!

To organize all of that design-related stuff, we create these docs pages. View them live at <https://songtech.github.io/Natron-Design-Docs>.

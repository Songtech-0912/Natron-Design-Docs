      <h1>Natron Design Documentation</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Natron Design Docs! These guidelines are intended to form the basis of designing for Natron, the open-source VFX and compositing software. Natron offers a comprehensive suite of tools for any compositor, enabling everything from basic video manipulation to cinematic multi-pass compositing. We believe that design is an integral part of establishing Natron as a fully-featured, professional compositing suite, and we have carefully put together these docs for that reason. As with all parts of Natron, these docs are a living document, and are freely available under an open-source license.</p>
<h2>Why Design?</h2>
<p>You might wonder why an open-source project like Natron would require designers. Surely, the features of the application are more important! So why waste valuable time on design?</p>
<p>Because open-source projects, especially ones like Natron, can have <em>great</em> potential. However, without good design, we have no way of showing that potential. There is a world of difference between open-source software with <em>good</em> design - like VS Code or Atom - and software with <em>bad design</em>. If Natron can aspire to professional design standards, we can realize that untapped potential. And we can release the amazing, community-building power of free and open-source software.</p>
<p>Conversely, users also have finite time and effort. They don't have all day to spend, looking for a compositing application, nor do they have the effort to extensively test each and every compositing application for its features. Most won't even care about free and open-source. And if they are presented with a terrible-looking user interface, they're not likely to want to use it. Even if they have to use it on a daily basis, using software with terrible GUIs – something Sibelius/Vim is famous for – becomes a pain.</p>
<p>Plus, design isn't just an aesthetical need - it's a practical one, too. Accessibility and responsive design are no longer optional in today's day and age. If your website isn't designed to scale properly on a mobile device, or to accomodate the needs of disadvantaged users, you are excluding a massive number of people from using your site.</p>
<h2>Our Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>We want to show that open-source projects and good design are not mutually exclusive. In other words, we want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create immersive and engaging experiences that breathe life into Natron</li>
<li>Create a recognizable visual identity that will represent our project</li>
<li>Laying down a foundation of intuitive tools that will help Natron grow</li>
</ul>
<p>Translating these abstract guiding principles something tangible is what design aims to do. The <em>implementation</em> is the hard part, but it's also what ultimately counts, and that's what we will discuss in these docs.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>This guide is intended for developers, hobbyists, professional designers, and novices alike. It's meant to take you into the mind of a designer, while also keeping design simple and easy to understand. If you're interested in those topics, read on! </p>
<h2>Implementation Guide</h2>
<h3>Natron's Approach to Design</h3>
<p>Here at Natron, we face tremendous challenges in encorporating design. We have a small design team, limited monetary resources, and Natron is non-profit. Furthermore, as an open-source project, we have high standards to live up to. Out of these special circumstances, we developed a unique approach to design.</p>
<p>First, where possible, we rely on open standards to share, work, and publish designs. Regardless of the software we use to make our mockups, we share designs as widely-supported SVG files. Then, we use <code>git</code> to synchronize our design assets (SVG or otherwise) to GitHub. That means we can do awesome things - like time travel! Designers can make breaking changes sometimes. But thanks to GitHub's version control, we can go back in time and grab the unchanged version, without a hitch!</p>
